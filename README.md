<h1 align="center">🧠 Assiut University Problem Sheets – C++ Solutions</h1>

<p align="center">
  Hello, and welcome to this repository!<br>
  I created this repo to share my <strong>solutions for the Assiut University problem sheets</strong> written in <strong>C++</strong>.<br>
  It contains some of my personal solutions, and it also serves as a <strong>useful reference</strong> for students who might solve these problems in the future.<br>
  I hope this helps others learn, improve, and write cleaner code while practicing problem-solving.

<h2>📜 About This Repository</h2>
<p>
  This repository is a complete collection of my personal solutions for the <strong>Assiut University Problem Sheets</strong> written in <strong>C++</strong>.  
  It was created to track my progress, share my learning journey, and help other students understand how to approach problem-solving effectively.  
  Each file inside represents an actual problem I solved step by step, using clean logic and proper coding style.  
  You’ll find explanations, structured code, and comments that make it easier to follow along and learn.  
  <br><br>
  The main purpose of this project is not only to provide answers, but also to build a strong foundation in <strong>programming logic</strong>, <strong>algorithmic thinking</strong>, and <strong>clean C++ coding practices</strong>.  
  Whether you’re a beginner or improving your problem-solving skills, this repository can be a great reference and guide.

<h2>📂 Repository Structure</h2>
<p>
  Each folder in this repository represents one full sheet (e.g., <code>Sheet-1</code>, <code>Sheet-2</code>, etc.).  
  Inside each folder, you will find the C++ source files for every problem in that sheet.
</p>

<h2>💡 Notes & Tips</h2>
<p>
  These solutions are mainly for educational purposes. I highly recommend you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try to solve each problem by yourself first.</li>
  <li>Use the provided solutions only for learning and comparing approaches.</li>
  <li>Read the comments inside the code to understand the logic step-by-step.</li>
  <li>Don’t copy blindly — learn the thinking process behind the solution.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Remember: The goal isn’t just to solve the problem, but to understand why the solution works.</b></p>
